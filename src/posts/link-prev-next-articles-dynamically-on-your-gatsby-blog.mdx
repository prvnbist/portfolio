## Introduction

Linking your next and previous article doesn't require any packages to be installed, infact it's quite simple to implement.

If you have an up and running blog with articles then you must have used Gatsby's `createPages` api. This api provides a `createPage` function that takes an object as it's first argument, gatsby refers to this object as `page` object. This page object takes following key's.
- `path` : a path url where your articles will be available to read from.
- `component` : a path to the react component that'll render the content of the article usually referred to as article template.
- `context` : an object using which you can pass any key-value that you would want to read from the article template.

We'll be using the `context` key to implement this functionality.

## Let's code

Each article rendered using article template get's a list of props from the `createPage` function. It contains a prop named `pageContext`. Any key-value, we define inside the `context` will be available through this pageContext prop. We'll be passing two keys named: `prev` and `next` representing details of previous and next article respectively.

### Getting details of next/previous articles

In order to get list of all articles, we use a GraphQL query. Something like -

```js
const result = await graphql(`
   query {

      // if you're using just markdown, replace allMdx with allMarkdownRemark
      allMdx(sort: { order: DESC, fields: [frontmatter___date] }) {
         edges {
            node {
               fields {
                  slug
               }
               frontmatter {
                  title
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
`)
```

This essentially returns all the articles, in the query above, the field `edges` represent list of all the articles and the field `node` represent each article. Let's assign the `edges` to a variable.

```js
const articles = result.data.allMdx.edges
```

Now to get the next and previous article we can just use `articles[index-1].node` for previous article and `articles[index+1].node` for next article. And incase if it's the first article, previous would be `null` and for the last article `next` would be `null`.

### For previous article

```js
articles.forEach(({ node }, index) => {
   createPage({
      ...
      context: {
         ...
         prev: index === 0 ? null : articles[index - 1].node
      }
   })
})
```

### For next article

```js
articles.forEach(({ node }, index) => {
   createPage({
      ...
      context: {
         ...
         next: index === articles.length - 1 ? null : articles[index + 1].node
      }
   })
})
```

Now we have access to the details of previous and next articles inside article template to render links for them.

## Using the pageContext

In our article template, we can destructure the props to get the `pageContext` like

```js
const Article = ({ pageContext }) => {}
```

Let's extract details of prev/next and save them into variables.

### For previous article
```js
const prev = pageContext.prev
   ? {
         url: `/blog/${pageContext.prev.fields.slug}`,
         title: pageContext.prev.frontmatter.title
      }
   : null
```

### For next article
```js
const next = pageContext.next
   ? {
         url: `/blog/${pageContext.next.fields.slug}`,
         title: pageContext.next.frontmatter.title
      }
   : null
```

Now render them on your article using `jsx`.

```jsx
<div>
   {prev && (
      <Link to={prev.url}>
         <span>Previous</span>
         <h3>{prev.title}</h3>
      </Link>
   )}
   {next && (
      <Link to={next.url}>
         <span>Next</span>
         <h3>{next.title}</h3>
      </Link>
   )}
</div>
```

That's pretty much it, with a little `CSS` flair you can make it look niceðŸ˜‰

### For Reference

I've used this same logic on my gatsby blog as well. For reference, take a look at my [article template](https://github.com/prvnbist/portfolio/blob/466ab103bc76664896dcbb02ba4bac02099cbfc3/src/templates/blog/index.jsx#L33 "article template") and my [gatsby-node.js](https://github.com/prvnbist/portfolio/blob/466ab103bc76664896dcbb02ba4bac02099cbfc3/gatsby-node.js#L17 "gatsby-node.js") file and to see it in action, just scroll a littleðŸ˜…
