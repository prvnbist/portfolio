In our previous article, we covered the basics of setting up a Django project and created our `Exercise` model, which we displayed on the front end as a list. In this article, we’ll dive into performing `CRUD` operations. For those unfamiliar, `CRUD` stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete—essentially the four fundamental actions you can perform on your data.

Now that we have our API set up in the `app` folder, we’ll simply extend the `index` view to handle create, update, and delete requests.
## The Form

Let’s set up a form that allows users to create exercises. We’ll be using HTML templates for this purpose once again. To get started, create a new template called `add_exercise.html` in the `app/templates` folder.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/">
	{% csrf_token %}
	<input type="text" name="title" placeholder="Enter the title" />
	<input type="date" name="date"  placeholder="Enter the date" />
	<button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

Next, in our `index.html` template, we’ll include the `add_exercise.html` template using the following method:

```html
{% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}
	<h2>Exercises</h2>
	{% include 'add_exercise.html' %}
...
{% endblock %}
```

We’re utilizing the `include` tag here, which promotes composability across HTML templates, making our code easier to maintain and understand. If you refresh the page in your browser, you should see the form appear on the screen.

In our HTML, we're using the `<form>` tag with the `method` attribute set to `POST` and the `action` attribute pointing to `/`, which is the same endpoint we use to fetch the list of exercises.

In this context, the `csrf_token` is a security feature represented by a randomly generated secret value. It helps protect our form submissions from forgery attacks, which is what `CSRF` stands for—Cross-Site Request Forgery. A unique token is generated for each user session, and it is not accessible by third-party sites, thereby preventing unauthorised changes from occurring.

Our form includes two input fields: one for the `title` and another for the `date`, following the schema of our `Exercise` model. When the form is submitted, the values for `title` and `date` will be sent via a `POST` request to the `/` endpoint, which will then be processed by our `index` view in `app/views.py`.

## The Model

In Django, we can enhance our `Exercise` model—essentially a Python class—by adding specific methods that correspond to `CRUD` operations. In the `app/models.py` file, we’ll include the following:

```python
class Exercise(models.Model):
	...
	
	def create(request):
		title = request.POST.get('title')
		date = request.POST.get('date')
		
		exercise = Exercise.objects.create(title=title, date=date)
		
		return exercise
```

We can access `title` and `date` from the `POST` request, as shown in the code above. Then, we can utilize Django's built-in ORM to create a new exercise and return the created instance.

We'll leverage the same `index` view we use to retrieve exercises, expanding it to check if the request method is `POST`. If so, we'll pass the request object to the class method we previously defined. Once the exercise is created, we'll redirect the user back to the homepage or perform a page refresh, ensuring the newly added exercise appears on the screen.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

from app import models

...

def index(request):
	if request.method == 'POST':
		models.Exercise.create(request)
		return redirect('/')
  
	exercises = (
		models.Exercise.objects.all().order_by("created_at")
	)
	return render(request, "index.html", context={'exercises': exercises})
```

Try creating a new exercise now, and you should see it appear at the bottom of the list.

## Update Exercise

Let's refactor our code a bit before adding update functionality to the exercises. We'll move the exercises to their own template called `exercise.html`.

```html
<h2>Exercises</h2>
{% include 'add_exercise.html' %}
<ul style="margin: 0; list-style: none; padding: 0">
	{% for exercise in exercises %}
		<li style="margin-top: 4px">
			{% include 'exercise.html' %}
		</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

Create a template for `exercise.html` in the `app/templates` folder, and we’ll add the following HTML to it:

```html
<form method="POST" action="/">
	{% csrf_token %}
	<input hidden name="id" value="{{exercise.id}}" />
	<input
		type="text"
		name="title"
		value="{{exercise.title}}"
		placeholder="Enter the title"
	/>
	<input
		type="date"
		name="date"
		placeholder="Enter the date"
		value="{{exercise.date | date:'Y-m-d'}}"
	/>
	<button type="submit" name="update">Update</button>
</form>
```

We’re using the `<form>` tag again for each exercise in the list and adding a hidden input for `exercise.id`, which will be used to update the exercise. Go back to the browser and refresh the page; you should see a form for each exercise in the list, with each input pre-filled with the corresponding exercise data.

![Final Look](https://res.cloudinary.com/prvnbist/image/upload/v1721883605/python-tutorial/image_11.jpg)

Notice that we’re not using `PUT` as the form method; instead, we’re using `POST`. This is because the view handlers can only parse data sent through `GET` and `POST` requests, with no built-in support for `PUT` and `DELETE`. When we created the `create` class method in the `Exercise` class, you might have noticed we used `request.POST.get('title')`. While this works for `POST` requests, there are no `PUT` or `DELETE` methods available in the `request` object.

But how do we differentiate between a `POST` and a `PUT` request? If you check the form we created earlier, you’ll notice that we assigned a `name` attribute to the submit button. We can access this attribute in the same way we accessed `title` and `date`, using `request.POST.get('update')`.

Let's update the create exercise form to include the same change.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/">
	...
	<button type="submit" name="create">Save</button>
</form>
```

And in our `exercises` view, we’ll make the following changes to differentiate between requests.

```python
def index(request):
	if request.method == 'POST':
		create = 'create' in request.POST
		update = 'update' in request.POST
		
		if create == True:
			models.Exercise.create(request)
		elif update == True:
			models.Exercise.update(request)
			
		return redirect('/')
  
	exercises = (
		models.Exercise.objects.all().order_by("created_at")
	)
	return render(request, "index.html", context={'exercises': exercises})
```

We check for the button name and forward the request to the appropriate `Exercise` method accordingly.

Let's add an `update` class method to the `Exercise` model in `app/models.py`.

```python
def update(request):
	id = request.POST.get('id')
	title = request.POST.get('title')
	date = request.POST.get('date')
	
	exercise = Exercise.objects.filter(pk=id).update(title=title, date=date)
	
	return exercise
```

To update a row in the database, we can use the `update` method available on the `Exercise` model. However, before updating, we need to ensure that we are updating the correct exercise. To do this, we filter the exercises by the primary key, which is `id`, and update only that specific exercise.

## Delete Exercise

Similarly, we’ll add a delete button next to each exercise in the `exercise.html` template.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/">
	...
	<button type="submit" name="update">Update</button>
	<button type="submit" name="delete">Delete</button>
</form>
```

We’ll set `delete` as the value of the `name` attribute, and in `views.py`, we’ll extend the `if...elif` statements to handle the delete operation.

```python
def index(request):
	if request.method == 'POST':
		create = 'create' in request.POST
		update = 'update' in request.POST
		delete = 'delete' in request.POST
		
		if create == True:
			models.Exercise.create(request)
		elif update == True:
			models.Exercise.update(request)
		elif delete == True:
			models.Exercise.delete(request)
			
		return redirect('/')
  
	exercises = (
		models.Exercise.objects.all().order_by("created_at")
	)
	return render(request, "index.html", context={'exercises': exercises})
```

And in the `Exercise` model, we'll add the class method `delete`.

```python
def delete(request):
	id = request.POST.get('id')
	is_deleted = Exercise.objects.filter(pk=id).delete()
	
	if is_deleted == 1:
		return True
		
	return False
```

With this addition, we've successfully implemented CRUD operations in our Python and Django application.

## Key Takeaways

1. Django view handlers do not support `PUT` and `DELETE` requests, as they do not parse the query parameters or request body for those HTTP methods. As a result, we must rely on `POST` requests and differentiate between them by passing an additional field in the request body. 
2. Noticed that I'm making the `POST` request to the same route from which I'm fetching the exercises. This is important because if you were to create an endpoint like `/api/exercises` to handle requests, you would need to manage redirection manually. Otherwise, the behavior of the `<form>` tag after the request is to redirect the user to the endpoint specified in the `action` attribute. Therefore, you will need to manually redirect the user back to the desired page, or in our case, keep the user on the same page.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

def index(request):
	...
	
	return redirect('/')
	# or
	return HttpResponseRedirect(request.META['HTTP_REFERER'])
```

In summary, by effectively managing our `POST` requests and ensuring proper redirection, we can create a seamless user experience while implementing CRUD operations in our Django application.
